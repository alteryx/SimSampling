```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
pluginName = 'SimSampling.yxmc'
```

Simulation Sampling allows for sampling. The sampling can be done parametrically from a distribution, from input data, or as a combination - best fitting to a distribution and sampling from that. The data can also be "drawn", if one is unsure of the parameters of a distribution but is also lacking data.

_Note: This tool uses the R tool. Install R and the necessary packages by going to Options > Download Predictive Tools._

### Inputs

There are 2 inputs.

```{r echo = F, comment = NA, results = 'asis', warning = F}
AlteryxRhelper::extractInputOutput(pluginName)
```

### Configuration Properties

```{r echo = F, comment = NA, results = 'asis', warning = F}
AlteryxRhelper::extractConfig(pluginName)
```

### Output

```{r echo = F, comment = NA, results = 'asis', warning = F}
AlteryxRhelper::extractInputOutput(pluginName, type = 'output')
```
